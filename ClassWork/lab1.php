        <h1>Hello World I have arrived!</h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Rene<br>
            I am taking this class because i am really interested in creating dynamic website.  
            I have created a few websites before but it has typically been with html.  
            I would like to upgrade my game by incorporating php with some html.  
            My educational goal has always been real simple learn as much as you can and as often as you can.  
            I am a life time learner.  I think learning new things is one of the best things people can do.  
            The only thing that trumps learning new things is executing and implementing the new things that i learn.  
            As far as a career goal i am already in the IT field and i just want to continue to sharpen my IT saw 
            since things in IT are always changing.  One of my worst fear in the career field is becoming obsolete 
            with knowledge and technology in IT </p>
